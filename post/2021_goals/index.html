    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Similar to 2020, I&rsquo;m going with 5 main goals that allow me flexibility in order to be happy with my accomplishments.</p>
<p>1 - <em>Regular Meditation</em></p>
<p>While I plan to eventually make this daily, my current goal is 5 days a week for at least 5 minutes each time.
I started meditating at the end of 2020 and found it had all sorts of positives for my life.
I was able to be more in touch with what was happening around me and live more in the moment, but also I started to understand what makes me feel certain ways.
Sitting quietly with my thoughts and trying to settle them through mindfulness makes it quite clear what things make me feel happy or excited or even confused.</p>
<p>As well, meditation allows me to switch between mentally heavy tasks much more easily. I often find that after I get super into solving a problem, I end up thinking about it much beyond when I want to.
Meditation has helped me to calm those thoughts and actually enjoy other things.
I can go from solving a complex problem to reading quietly with just a meditation session in between and I find I get a much richer reading experience than if I don&rsquo;t take that break between tasks.
Through 2021 I plan to improve on this skill and use it to make me into a happier and mentally healthier person.</p>
<p>2 - <em>New Experiences</em></p>
<p>I want to expand my world and try new things. The plan is 1 new experience each month, with a loose definition on what that entails.</p>
<p>This idea came about through discussions on how 2020 has really required us to be more creative in terms of activities that we can do from home.
I tend to like to stick with what I know, ad when at home this entails a lot of sitting and not doing as many enjoyable things as I would like to do.
This may require a bit of creativity, but knowing that I have to hold myself responsible will give me the push to keep trying new things.</p>
<p>3 - <em>New Meals/Recipes</em></p>
<p>Similar to trying different experiences, I want to try different foods. This will also be with a goal of 1 a month.</p>
<p>This is really to make sure that I have a more balanced diet and that I don&rsquo;t get stuck eating the same things month after month.
A lot of these will likely be easy recipes that will hopefully become staples in my diet, but some will be harder to make and I&rsquo;ll need to put time and effort into planning and making them.</p>
<p>4 - <em>Data Projects</em></p>
<p>I want to continue to expand my data science knowledge. Last year I focused mainly on courses.
This year will be personal projects, at least for the first few months. My goal is to complete 1 project every 6 weeks.</p>
<p>I know that my favourite way to learn and the way that I most stay focused is when I&rsquo;m trying to solve a problem.
Even if the consequence of not solving it is just that I don&rsquo;t get to complete a project, that&rsquo;s more than enough to get me lost in learning for hours.
I still strongly believe that online courses are very valuable, however I will use them to fill in gaps this year as opposed to the main source of learning.</p>
<p>5 - <em>Code More</em></p>
<p>This will connect with the above point, but will also allow me to learn outside of what I need for a project.
With this, I&rsquo;m going to take up #100daysofcode to ensure that I not only work on this, but that I post about what I learn.</p>
<p>I built a lot of good habits last year. Podcasts and reading became daily occurances for me and I noticed a big increase in my knowledge and understanding.
This is why I want this to be as close to daily as possible. I&rsquo;m only requiring 10 minutes minimum for this to count as I know that once I get to my computer I&rsquo;m likely to spend much longer than that.</p>
