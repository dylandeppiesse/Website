      <description>I never would have expected that trying to create a website to showcase my work would in itself become such a project.
This is the first time that I have attempted to build something like this and I&amp;rsquo;m extremely happy with the result. I built this using Hugo, which allows for building static pages that can then be hosted on GitHub, which is what I have done.
Not only was this my first foray into creating a site, it was also my first real use of GitHub - a skill which I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to learn for a while now.</description>

      <description>My first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; project in terms of finding a dataset and turning it into something.
This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying I&amp;rsquo;ll do for a while and I finally forced myself to just start and see where it goes. Regardless of what the outcome was, I simply knew that starting 1 project would lead to working on more and improving as I went.
My goal was to keep it simple.</description>
