Data Analyst 

BA Economics, Minor Labour Studies

I decided to start learning Data Science on my own at the beginning of 2019. 
After spending a year and a half working as a Data Analyst, I wanted to increase my awareness of the data world around me.


During my BA in Economics, I came across linear regression and thought it was one of the most powerful and amazing things I had ever seen.
The only problem was that I thought that I needed more education to learn how to use these techniques.
Thankfully I stumbled upon Machine Learning and realized that I could learn it on my own. This portfolio is part of my journey.
