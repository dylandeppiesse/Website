      <description>Similar to 2020, I&amp;rsquo;m going with 5 main goals that allow me flexibility in order to be happy with my accomplishments.
1 - Regular Meditation
While I plan to eventually make this daily, my current goal is 5 days a week for at least 5 minutes each time. I started meditating at the end of 2020 and found it had all sorts of positives for my life. I was able to be more in touch with what was happening around me and live more in the moment, but also I started to understand what makes me feel certain ways.</description>

      <description>Setting goals for 2020 was a fantastic idea and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to the version of myself that decided to do this a year ago. These gave me direction and structure when I needed it and also gave me enough flexibility to pivot and still feel that I completed what I wanted to. I didn&amp;rsquo;t meet all of my goals and I&amp;rsquo;m happy about that - it means that I made them challenging enough.</description>
