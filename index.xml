      <title>2021 Goals</title>

      <description>Similar to 2020, I&amp;rsquo;m going with 5 main goals that allow me flexibility in order to be happy with my accomplishments.
1 - Regular Meditation
While I plan to eventually make this daily, my current goal is 5 days a week for at least 5 minutes each time. I started meditating at the end of 2020 and found it had all sorts of positives for my life. I was able to be more in touch with what was happening around me and live more in the moment, but also I started to understand what makes me feel certain ways.</description>

      <title>2020 Goals - Looking Back</title>

      <description>Setting goals for 2020 was a fantastic idea and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to the version of myself that decided to do this a year ago. These gave me direction and structure when I need it and also gave me enough flexibility to pivot and still feel that I completed what I wanted to. I didn&amp;rsquo;t meet all of my goals and I&amp;rsquo;m happy about that - it means that I made them challenging enough.</description>

My first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; project in terms of finding a dataset and turning it into something.
This is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying I&amp;rsquo;ll do for a while now, and I finally forced myself to just start and see where it goes. Regardless of what the outcome was, I simply knew that starting 1 project would lead to working on more and improving as I went.</description>

      <title>Creating this website</title>

      <description>I never would have expected that trying to create a website to showcase my work would in itself become such a project.
This is the first time that I have attempted to build something like this and I&amp;rsquo;m extremely happy with the result. I built this using Hugo, which allows for building static pages that can then be hosted on GitHub, which is what I have done.
Not only was this my first foray into creating a site, it was also my first real use of GitHub - a skill which I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to learn for a while now.</description>
